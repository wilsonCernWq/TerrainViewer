# imgui Freeglut example

```
imgui_impl_glut.h
imgui_impl_glut.cpp
```

Above two files implemente imgui freeglut bindings, which come from a github project [imgui_freeglut](https://github.com/azer89/imgui_freeglut).

```
main.cpp
```

This simple file demostrates how to integrate imgui with freeglut. Fixed window updating and mouse scroll binding bugs.
